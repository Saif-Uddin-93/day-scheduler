# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This project was created to create a work day scheduling app. The aim was to able to store notes for each hour of the day and be able add notes for future dates or look back at past notes. The project meets the following criteria:

* On loading/refreshing the page, the business hours for the current day is shown.
* Any saved information is loaded if it exists.
* Any past hours/dates, the descriptions are grey; the current hour on the present day is red; and any future hours/dates are green.
* If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock
* Able to select past and future dates with default as the present day.
* All saved data is stored locally.

The main things I've learned from this project are:

* Gained practical experience with JQuery, JQuery UI and DayJS.
* Pratice with writing more readable code.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Installation

For this project, the developer tool I'll be using is VS Code. A lightweight IDE that allows working in JavaScript. It also allows the use of Extensions which can add extra functionality to the tool to help with debugging and making code more readable. The main extension I'll be using is called, Live Server, by Ritwick Dey. The browser that the web page will be used on is Google Chrome and will work on all Chromium-based web browsers. This project also includes the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/docs/en/display/format), JQuery, JQuery UI and Bootstrap frameworks.

## Usage

The calendar can display calendar events for selected dates as shown in the GIF below:

Scores are saved on the browsers local storage so the player would need to delete them manually using the developer tool or by clearing cache.
